Data Pipelines
==============

*Data Pipelines* are used to convert from arbitrary data into a matrix/tensor that can be consumed by machine learning algorithms.

Developer Quick Start
---------------------
Note that these commands should be invoked within the root of the repository.

**Linux**

1) Run `sudo bootstrap.sh ..`
    
    This will need to happen once per machine or after a repository has moved to a different directory. Note that `sudo` is not necessary when running within a Docker container.

2) Run `source ./Activate.sh <python|x64>`

    This will need to happen each time a new terminal window is opened.

**Windows**

1) Run `bootstrap.cmd ..`

    This will need to happen once per machine or after a repository has moved to a different directory.

2) Run `Activate.cmd <python|x64>`

    This will need to happen each time a new terminal window is opened.
